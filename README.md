## Description

JATE is just another text editor that not only meets PWA (Progressive Web Application) criteria, but allows developers to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection.  It's functionality with the latter is especially important because it allows the developers to reliably retrieve their text they entered without internet connection at a later time.  

JATE, a single-page application, also features a number of data persistence techniques including the IndexedDB API, service workers, and webpack that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser.
